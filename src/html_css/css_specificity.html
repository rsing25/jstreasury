<!--Note: Specificity is a common reason

Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. 
There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

Inline styles - An inline style is attached directly to the element to be styled. 
    Example: <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">.

IDs - An ID is a unique identifier for the page elements, 
    such as #navbar.

Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes - This category includes .classes, [attributes] and pseudo-classes 
    such as :hover, :focus etc.

Elements and pseudo-elements - This category includes element names and pseudo-elements, 
    such as h1, div, :before and :after.


    calculate

    add 1000 for style attribute, 
    add 100 for each ID, 
    add 10 for each attribute, class or pseudo-class, 
    add 1 for each element name or pseudo-element.

    A: h1
B: #content h1
C: <div id="content"><h1 style="color: #ffffff">Heading</h1></div>

The specificity of A is 1 (one element)
The specificity of B is 101 (one ID reference and one element)
The specificity of C is 1000 (inline styling)

Since 1 < 101 < 1000, the third rule (C) has a greater level of specificity, 
and therefore will be applied.
