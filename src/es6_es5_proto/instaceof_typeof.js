"string"	Operand is a string
"boolean"	Operand is a Boolean
"object"	Operand is an object
null		Operand is null.
"undefined"	Operand is not defined.

What is null?
There are two features of null you should understand:

1) null is an empty or non-existent value.
2) null must be assigned.
Hereâ€™s an example. We assign the value of null to a:

let a = null;
console.log(a);
// null

What is undefined?
1)Undefined most typically means a variable has been declared, but not defined.

For example:

let b;
console.log(b);
// undefined
