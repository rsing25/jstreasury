CSS Grid vs Flexbox
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows,
 unlike flexbox which is largely a one-dimensional system (either in a column or a row).

 A core difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox is that — CSS Grid’s approach is layout-first while Flexbox’ approach is content-first. 
If you are well aware of you content before making layout, then blindly opt for Flexbox and if not, opt for CSS Grid.

Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application (as most of them are fundamentally linear),
 and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts which aren’t linear in their design.


 f you only need to define a layout as a row or a column, then you probably need flexbox. 
 If you want to define a grid and fit content into it in two dimensions — you need the grid.
