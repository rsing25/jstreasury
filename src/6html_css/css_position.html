<!--
    he position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element 

1) relative	The element is positioned relative to its normal position, 
            so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position

 an element’s original position remains in the flow of the document, 
. But now left/right/top/bottom/z-index will work. 
The positional properties “nudge” the element from the original position in that direction.            

2) absolute	The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element
 the element is removed from the flow of the document 
 and other elements will behave as if it’s not even there whilst all the other positional properties will work on it.


3) fixed	    The element is positioned relative to the browser window	

 the element is removed from the flow of the document like absolutely positioned elements. In fact they behave almost the same,

4) sticky	The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position
A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
