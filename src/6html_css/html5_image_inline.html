<!--
  image tag
  Display inline
  Null element    This element must not contain any content, and does not need a closing tag.

  All <img> tags must have a defined src attribute.

  because of historical reasons, the HTML specification (and all browsers, by default)
  treat the <img> tag as if it is an inline element. Because of the way browsers handle white space,
    this can cause problems if you are not careful.


  A way of handling the inline image problem is to images into block elements with CSS.

  img {
    display: block;
  }

  Responsive Images
  t's important to make sure that images display correctly across a wide variety of screen widths and window sizes.
  One of the easiest techniques for accomplishing this is to use CSS to set the width (or the max-width) to 100%. 
  This will ensure that the image is never too big for its container. 
  When used in conjunction with a flexible-grid system, 
  this optimizes the images display size for various screen widths
